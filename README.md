# AnagramCheckProgram

This repository contains a simple program to identify for all pairs in list of pairs of strings as anagram or not.

Program flow:
1. End user will be asked to input number of pairs to be tested
2. End user will then have to enter all the pairs with each input prompt
3. For each pair of strings, a message will be displayed if the pair is anagram or not.

The example workflow is as shown below:
